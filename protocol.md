What I know till now about electromyography and Joshihiro's Research

Electromyography is used to measure electrical signals to the muscles. These signals are fired before the muscle contracts. This offset is used by Joshihiro to guess wrist movements before they are happening. This is important for real-time interaction with a haptic interface. He proved that before the hand starts to move one can detect a cubic signal growth.

<http://science.howstuffworks.com/prosthetic-limb4.htm>

Because muscles generate small electrical signals when they contract, electrodes placed on the surface of the skin can measure muscle movements. Although no buttons are physically pressed by the muscles in this case, their contractions are detected by the electrodes and then used to control the prosthetic limb -- in a way similar to the switch control method that was just described. Prosthetic limbs that function in this way are called myoelectric.

use cases: prosthesis or *predictive haptic displays*

-   2008 Shenoy `Online Electromyographic Control of a Robotic Prosthesis` - 2012 Kuroda `Prior estimation of motion using recursive perceptron with     sEMG: A case of wrist angle`

Methods for onset detection in sEMG

Threshold-based: *Muscle activation onset* is detected when the *sEMG* signal exceeds critical threshold.

-   1996 Hodges `A comparison of computer-based methods for the determination of     onset of muscle contraction using electromyography`

Statistically optimal decision: it assumes statistical properties of signals, estimates the parameters of the assumed distributions, and detects onset when these parameters change. Comparison:

-   2001 Stande `Onset detection in surface electromyographic signals: a     systematic comparison of methods, Eurasip Journal on Applied` - 2011 Lopez `Surface Electromyographic Onset Detection Based On Statistics and     Information Content` - 2008 Rosa `A novel electromyographic signal     simulator     for muscle contraction studies`

because performance is noise-sensitive \> no *appropriate* method

-   During movement, muscles are *recruited* gradually + temporal properties of *recruitment* are expressed in the *sEMG* signal + under a specific movement *sEMG* would reflect its temporal characteristics - method proposed:`robust     real-time sEMG onset detection` by `beginning-of-motion template matching`

Point to point movements:

-   2008 Ben-Itzhak `The Minimum Acceleration with Constraints model [11]     suggests that at the beginning of movement, the third derivative of     position, jerk, changes abruptly from zero to some constant value, resulting     in a position trajectory that can be described as a cubic power of time     after onset.`

## Prior Estimation of Motion Using Recursive Perceptron with sEMG: A Case of Wrist Angle

[2012kuroda][]

**sEMG** surface electromyography

**sEMG** measures the amount of naturally emitted electrical activity your muscles release when contracting. A dynamic test is performed with EKG stick-on electrodes while the user goes through a series of movements (bending, rotating, flexing, ...). It is a technique for evaluation and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. The instrument measures the *electrical potential* generated by muscle cells. The *electrical potential* at a point is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point charge would have when located at that point.

## Automatic Cropping Method of Chest Radiographs Based on Adaptive Binarization

[2013imura][]

-   Image Analysis - known processes: adaptive binarization - not sure about use

-   not to much new medical words **future** - improvement of speed and accuracy

    -   other body parts - should be in software soon - radiologist able to identify - else new training data created

## goal finding

-   what do I want to do?

## gesture recognition

[1987zimmerman][]

-   glove for 3d-hand reconstruction - hand position and orientation

**object manipulation**

-   pick up - rotate - throw - squeeze **commands**

-   draw a line - produce a sound - set a color

**signs**

-   *static* victory / peace sign - *dynamic* waving hand

normal mouse interaction:

-   select object - select operation

## timeline

-   now what... ask the Japanese `Tomoki`? - met `Jojo`, a Mongolian guy - ate `Ku`-something Soba... not again - searched features of `Asus Xtion Pro` (`kinect` like camera) - searched paper about gesture recognition \> material
