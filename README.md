trial and error at toyonaka

I still try to choose what to do with surface electromyography, so nothing to bother about in this repo.

1. continue [Kuroda's research](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors:.QT.Kuroda,%20Yoshihiro.QT.&newsearch=true)
2. user study
3. robot control
4. machine learning algorithm

Looks like it's going to be a mixture of all.
